        <p>
          ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm a self-taught frontend developer.
          <br />
          I got interested in development because Iâ€™ve always been into building
          things and loved the idea of creating websites and applications.
          <br />
          I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Typescript, and enjoy
          working with frameworks like React.
          <br />
          I'm passionate about creating apps that can improve people's lives and
          adding little details that make the experience more enjoyable for
          everyone.
          <br />
          I'm always excited to learn new things and improve my skills. When I'm
          not coding, you can find me making illustrations or hanging out with
          my cat Eris.
        </p>
